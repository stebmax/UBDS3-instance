An example of code for application to Ukrainian Biological Data Science Summer School (UBDS^3) 2024.

This program opens a txt file with some unstructured text and extracts all computer-science-related terms and definitions from it into a database. It was actually an English assignment for a friend of mine who is a computer scientist. He had to learn all this definitions by heart and then retell them during the test. Since the file is so big and written in plane text, it was hard for my friend to navigate through it quickly so as to cheat during the test. That's why I have written this program that reads through the file, automatically detects all words and definitions and stores them in a database with the ability to find the needed words quickly. The problem was that the file itself turned out to be unstructured, and detecting words and definitions was not as easy as I had thought. Some typos had been made by a teacher, as well as there were no distinct boundaries between definitions. So I had to come up with an algorithm that would extract, clean and load the data into a database.
